## Proposed title

`To develop machine learning algorithm for visualizing heterogenous multidimentional 
phenomics and genomics data`

## Objectives
- To develop ML algorithm to visualize individual-level signature based on multiple phenotypes
	- Develop algorithm to capture phenotype to phenotype relationship
	- Develop algorithm to capture within Prakriti signatures
	- Develop algorithm to capture between Prakriti signatures
	- Design visual representation of individual-level signature based on above algorithms 
	
- To develop ML algorithm to associate phenotype with gene expression 
	- Use existing methodologies to find above associations
	- Develop novel ML algorithms to find multi-phenotype association with molecular cues.

## Background
Technological advancement in high-throughput experiments (HTE) allow us to decipher 
many biological insights such as, how transcription factor interact with downstream 
genes, with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithm play a very
vital and integral part of understand complex biological event where we profile
multitude of genes and uncover patterns from it. Most HTE involve experients, where
the phenotype of interest (<strong>X<sub>pheno</sub></strong>) is simple such as (case/control, normal/disease conditions)
and accordingly we developed algorithms to infer genes(<strong>Y<sub>g</sub></strong>) as predictors of the phenotypes (eg., cancer).
In recent years, we started appreciating the fact that other covariate such as
age, sex, environmental conditions along with our phenotype of interest could
play a vital role in regulation within cellular. Overview of phenomics and genomics data is illustrated below in Figure-01.
